{"id":27,"count":3,"description":"Essential for daily life and health, access to clean water is not always a simple proposition for families and communities in the Horn of Africa region (East Africa). In many parts of the region, the lack of adequate infrastructure to meet sustainable water solutions has caused much suffering, not to mention the ongoing cycle of drought and flooding caused by the effects of climate change. So women and children are often required to walk miles each day to fetch water from the nearest collection point for household and agricultural needs. These long walks put women and children at risk for violence or attack from wildlife, as well as preventing opportunities to pursue work or school. Furthermore, water collected from these distant locations is not always potable water and can lead to diseases, miscarriage, and even death sometimes. When you come to grip that not only rural areas but the majority of some countries in the region lack this basic human right: H2O. it might seem like a daunting task to undertake. But the solutions arecloser than the sunrise, and you will find that it\u2019s not always about large scale infrastructure projects, but simple infrastructures can make a huge difference to sustain people for many years. For the past twenty years, with the support of our donors and partners, we have worked to provide sustainable water solutions suitable with the demographics and topography of each region and meeting the demands of different communities. We have installed close to 500 simple hand-pumped water wells across the region. Working with community leaders to build them within the village or a nearby school, which directly impacts the community health, wellness, and sanitation indicators. But equally importantly, no one has to walk for hours so they can pursue their education or a career. To further expand our comprehensive effort, over the past couple of years, we have been transitioning more into more innovative solutions. These include building solar water wells, installing water catchments at schools, and our latest pilot program; building Sand dams.","link":"https:\/\/araha.org\/product-category\/araha-water-programs\/","name":" WorldKind ReliefWater Programs","slug":"araha-water-programs","taxonomy":"product_cat","parent":0,"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat\/27"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/product_cat"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product?product_cat=27"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
