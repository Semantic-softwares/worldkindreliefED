{"id":30,"count":3,"description":"ARAHA\u2019s programs are all guided by a desire to create viable pathways to opportunity and economic independence for families in the Horn. Projects in the self-reliance program area specifically encourage and support the entrepreneurial thinking and community solutions of WorldKind Relief  beneficiaries by providing them with the tools they need to thrive. The donor-orphan relationship is a special one in which an orphan feels empowered, and the donor feels a sense of humanity. Over the years, many children who have gone through our program become productive citizens who attend university, have careers and start families of their own.","link":"https:\/\/araha.org\/product-category\/araha-self-reliance-programs\/","name":" WorldKind ReliefSelf Reliance Programs","slug":"araha-self-reliance-programs","taxonomy":"product_cat","parent":0,"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat\/30"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/product_cat"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https:\/\/araha.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product?product_cat=30"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
