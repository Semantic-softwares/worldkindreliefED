										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bringing Life to a Challenged Community</h2>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Quljeed Town, Bordering Ethiopia<br />
<strong>Project Status:</strong> 80 meters dug out of an expected 150 meters</p>
<h3><strong>A Lifeline for Quljeed Town</strong></h3>
<p>At the beginning of this year, we embarked on a mission to provide sustainable water access to Quljeed, a remote town on the Ethiopian border. This community has seen a significant population increase, with people from surrounding areas flocking to</p>

<p>Quljeed in search of water. After meeting with the town&#8217;s mayor and elders, we chose the perfect site for a new borehole to support the growing needs of the region.<strong>Community-Driven Effort</strong></p>
<p>Despite the town&#8217;s challenges—rocky terrain and hard-to-reach locations—the community has shown remarkable resilience and support. Local residents have contributed what they can to this vital project, demonstrating their commitment to securing a better future.</p>
<p><strong>Current Progress</strong></p>
<p>Our team has already drilled 80 meters out of the planned 150 meters, overcoming difficult conditions to bring this essential resource closer to reality. Once completed, this borehole will tap into deep aquifers, providing a reliable source of clean water for decades to come.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Quljeed?</strong></h3>
<p>With its growing population and limited access to water, Quljeed has become a critical point of focus for our water initiatives. The town’s rocky landscape makes traditional water wells ineffective, but a deep borehole will ensure a consistent and lasting supply of water, transforming lives and health outcomes in the region.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Support Matters</strong></h3>
<p>This project is only possible with the generosity and support of donors like you. By contributing to the Quljeed Borehole project, you are helping to provide a sustainable source of water that will benefit thousands of people for generations. Every contribution makes a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>Join us in making a difference. Donate today to bring water—and hope—to the people of Quljeed.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Essential though it is for daily life and health, access to clean water is not always a simple proposition for families and communities in the Horn. Indeed, women and children are often required to walk miles each day in order to fetch water from the nearest well for household and agricultural needs. These long walks put women and children at risk of violence or attack from wildlife and people, and may also prevent opportunities to pursue work or school. Constructing water bore holes within or adjacent to villages has significant and direct impacts on community health, wellness, and sanitation indicators. As part of a comprehensive effort, WorldKind Relief  often seeks to incorporate sanitation improvements and training into water projects to multiply the benefits of each well we construct.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sand dams are the most cost-effective solution to the ongoing cycle of drought in the Horn of Africa region. Sand Dams capture millions of liters of rainwater and store it underground. One Sand Dam can provide up to 1000 people with drinking water for up to a year without rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Why Sand Dams</strong><br />
Over the past few decades, the Horn of Africa region has been known to have recurring droughts. And now with climate change and the El Niño weather pattern, you have both extremes; droughts, and floods. For many parts of this region, there is little to no infrastructure to contain the rainwater, and surge of river. So when it rains and there is a surge in the river, much of that is lost to the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Sand Dams can…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combat desertification by recharging groundwater.</li>
<li>Mitigate climate change by creating water security.</li>
<li>Reduce conflict by increasing access to water.</li>
<li>Support disaster resilience by creating a buffer against drought.</li>
<li>Enable the installation of shallow wells producing safe drinking water.</li>
</ul>
