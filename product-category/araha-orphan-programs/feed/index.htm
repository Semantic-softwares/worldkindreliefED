										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of WorldKind Relief ’s longest-running and most important projects is the orphan sponsorship program. There are thousands and thousands of orphaned children in the Horn, and the majority of them have nowhere to turn for their basic needs or to cover the costs of schooling for a better future.</p>
<p><strong>For only $50 a month, you can cover an orphan’s basic needs such as food, school fees, and healthcare.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our orphan program is large and complex, spanning multiple countries, several field offices, and hundreds of children. Orphan sponsorship payments are strictly dedicated to individual orphans, but the entire program requires funding to remain successful. A donation towards general orphan support will ensure that WorldKind Relief  can continue to provide food, healthcare, and educational opportunities to as many orphaned children as possible throughout the Horn.</p>
