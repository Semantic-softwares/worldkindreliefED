										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When crisis strikes in Kenya, WorldKind Relief  mobilizes quickly to give families the support they need to come out strong after such times of upheaval. In a region too often affected by drought, famine, and armed conflict, the resources and services WorldKind Relief  provides vary greatly according to the circumstances. Sometimes this entails emergency food baskets, while other times it involves trucking in clean water supplies or providing temporary shelter. Whatever the situation, WorldKind Relief  works to sustain families through difficult periods, giving them the opportunity to devise viable resiliency plans for the future. Our general disaster relief fund ensures we are never caught off guard when disaster strikes and that we are able to respond immediately and efficiently wherever we are needed.</p>
