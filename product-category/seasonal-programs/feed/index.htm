										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meat is a luxury that many poor people around the world seldom enjoy. WorldKind Relief  provides protein in the form of meat and fish as a charity to the poor. It adds much-needed nourishment to their diets.</p>
<p><strong>Akika:</strong><br />
Akika is a practice done by the Muslim community to show gratitude to the Creator for His Blessings of a new born baby. Parents may show this gratitude by sacrificing animals (such as sheep, goats) and prepare a meal from the meat and invite the community, including the poor to share in the joyous occasion. Parents who are unable to perform Aqiqah themselves can make a donation to WorldKind Relief  to sacrifice an animal on their behalf and distribute the meat to the poor.</p>
<p><strong>Zabiha:</strong><br />
Zabiha is a general form of charity through animal sacrifice and meat distribution to the poor. it is not limited to a specific time or occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Udhiya Qurbani is a practice done by Muslim communities across the world to commemorate the sacrifice done by Prophet Abraham. It is done during the Eid-ul-Adha holiday, in which goats, sheep, cows, and camels are slaughtered and given to the poor and destitute to help spread the joys of the holidays and festivities. It is a great way of fighting poverty as a society on a large scale.</p>
<p>You can help to contribute to this tradition of a sacrificial gift of Udhiya Qurbani. Whether you are Muslim or not, You have the opportunity to provide nourishment for families across the Horn of Africa, who otherwise might not have enough to eat. Our Udhiya/Qurbani program is one of the most affordable in the non-profit industry; with just $100 per goat or sheep, you can impact and feed about 20-25 people. The price per cow is $500.</p>
<p><strong>You can package this with an orphan gift today, and spreading joy further! </strong></p>
