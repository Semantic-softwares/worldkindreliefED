										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of our drought relief effort, WorldKind Relief  is shipping 6,804,000 meals to vulnerable people in the Horn of Africa, but we need your help to get this done!</p><p>Global supply chain issues have caused a significant increase in transportation costs and we need additional funding to ship 25 cargo containers of fortified rice packs to families who are on the brink of starvation. Our field team has identified a long wait list of beneficiaries who are in desperate need of food assistance but we need to get these shipments out by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only is this an important cause that will provide life sustaining nutrition to thousands of families, especially children, but this is an excellent opportunity for your business to be recognized internationally as a philanthropic partner. The value of this kind of social currency can be extremely beneficial in gaining support from your consumer base. WorldKind Relief  has over 250,000 followers across several social media platforms. We can provide your business with positive media exposure that will sharpen your competitive edge. Our organization employs a photojournalist to capture every aspect of the project and we will feature your logo or chosen dedication on our banner. We will work with you to create a marketing strategy that will benefit your company.&nbsp;</p><p>Each container costs $15,000, which includes shipment from the United State to the Horn of Africa, customs fees, in-land transportation, and distribution. WorldKind Relief  is a registered 501c3 and your donation is tax deductible.&nbsp;</p><p>Please email Hope at&nbsp; developmentdirector@araha.org if you’d like to discuss a partnership or if you need any additional information about this project. Please don’t hesitate to reach out, we are always looking to strengthen our partnerships and are open to tailoring a project to fit your philanthropic needs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="768" height="994" data-id="722" src="https://araha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/shippingcontainers-768x994-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-722" srcset="https://araha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/shippingcontainers-768x994-1.png 768w, https://araha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/shippingcontainers-768x994-1-600x777.png 600w, https://araha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/shippingcontainers-768x994-1-232x300.png 232w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crisis in the Horn of Africa has grown exponentially.</p><p>While WorldKind Relief  has been working to provide drought-crisis aid to The Horn, a new crisis has arisen.</p><p>In Sudan, torrential rainfalls have begun, creating flooding that communities are unprepared for. The United Nations estimates that 136,000 people have already been affected by the flooding, which is likely to increase. In Sudan, 14,500 homes have already been destroyed, and 77 people have lost their lives. The flooding destroys property, infrastructure, and crops, putting people’s livelihoods at risk.</p><p>According to the United Nations, the flooding in 2021 affected 314,500 people; they expect that number to at least double this year. As with the drought crisis, we cannot allow history to repeat itself. The data is heartbreaking. In 2021, 80,00+ homes were destroyed, and 80 people were killed. Even worse, in 2020, 100,000+ homes were destroyed, and 100 people lost their lives.</p><p> WorldKind Reliefneeds your help to provide immediate aid to families affected by floods across the Horn of Africa region.</p><p>Your contribution is crucial in helping to restore livelihoods and hope for families in need.</p>]]></content:encoded>
